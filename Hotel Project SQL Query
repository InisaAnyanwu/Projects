Answering the question: Is the Hotel Revenue growing year over year? (There are two type of hotels, so breakdown the revenue by hotel type)

With all_hotels as (
Select * from dbo.['2018$']
Union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
Union
select * from dbo.['2020$'])
select stays_in_weekend_nights+stays_in_week_nights from all_hotels; --The is adding the nights on the weekend and during the week so we can find the revenue--

With all_hotels as (
Select * from dbo.['2018$']
Union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
Union
select * from dbo.['2020$'])
select (stays_in_weekend_nights + stays_in_week_nights)*adr as revenue from all_hotels; -- adr is the daily rate so multiplying it by the # of nights give you the revenue--

With all_hotels as (
Select * from dbo.['2018$']
Union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
Union
select * from dbo.['2020$'])
select arrival_date_year,sum((stays_in_weekend_nights+ stays_in_week_nights)*adr) as revenue from all_hotels
group by arrival_date_year; -- This give you the total revenue for each year --

With all_hotels as (
Select * from dbo.['2018$']
Union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
Union
select * from dbo.['2020$'])
select arrival_date_year, hotel,
sum((stays_in_weekend_nights+ stays_in_week_nights)*adr) as revenue from all_hotels
group by arrival_date_year,hotel -- This shows the revenue for each year with a breakdown for each hotel type ---
