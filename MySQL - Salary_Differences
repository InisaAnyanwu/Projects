-- Write a query that calculates the difference between the highest salaries found in the marketing and engineering departments.Outputs just the absolute difference in salaries.--

select * from db_dept;
select * from db_employee;

-- 1) Find the highest salary for the engineering Dept -- Answer: 45787
-- 2) Find the highes salary for the marketing Dept -- Answer: 48187
-- 3) Find the difference between the two salaries -- Answer: 2400

select distinctrow(max(salary)) as Max_Salary from db_employee join db_dept on db_employee.department_id = db_dept.id
Where db_dept.department = 'engineering';

select distinctrow(max(salary)) as Max_Salary from db_employee join db_dept on db_employee.department_id = db_dept.id
Where db_dept.department = 'marketing';

-- To find the difference I need to join this first query for engineering with the marketing query--
-- Use the Common Table Expression--
With eng as 
		(select distinctrow(max(salary)) as Max_Salary from db_employee join db_dept on db_employee.department_id = db_dept.id
		Where db_dept.department = 'engineering'),
	mkt as
		(select distinctrow(max(salary)) as Max_Salary from db_employee join db_dept on db_employee.department_id = db_dept.id
		Where db_dept.department = 'marketing')
Select abs(eng.max_salary - mkt.max_salary) as max_salary_difference from eng 
cross join mkt;
