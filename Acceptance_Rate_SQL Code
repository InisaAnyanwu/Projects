-- What is the overall friend acceptance rate by date? --
-- Your output should have the rate of acceptances by the date the request was sent. Order by the earliest date to latest --

SELECT * FROM fb_friend_requests;
-- Acceptance rate = accepted requests/total requests --

-- The best why is to use SELF-JOIN because we need to do some matching -- 

SELECT * FROM  fb_friend_requests AS sent JOIN fb_friend_requests AS accepted ON sent.user_id_sender = accepted.user_id_sender 
AND sent.user_id_receiver = accepted.user_id_receiver
WHERE sent.action = 'sent' AND accepted.action = 'accepted';

-- group by date ---

SELECT sent.date, count(1) AS total_accepted FROM  fb_friend_requests AS sent JOIN fb_friend_requests AS accepted ON sent.user_id_sender = accepted.user_id_sender 
AND sent.user_id_receiver = accepted.user_id_receiver
WHERE sent.action = 'sent' AND accepted.action = 'accepted' GROUP BY sent.date;
-- This shows the total of requests that have been accepted by the date --

-- total request sent --
select action, count(1) as total_sent from fb_friend_requests where action = 'sent';
-- OR --
select date, count(1) as total_sent from fb_friend_requests where action = 'sent' group by date;

-- Now it's time to join the two queries and divide them to get the acceptance rate --
-- This can be done by the WITH clause or with subquery --
